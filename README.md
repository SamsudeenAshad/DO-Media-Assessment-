## Preview & Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/SamsudeenAshad/DO-Media-Assessment-.git

2. Open the project folder in your editor of choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

3. Preview locally:
   - Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or run a simple local server:
     - Windows PowerShell: `python -m http.server 8080`
     - Then open: http://localhost:8080


## Development & Testing

- Use your browser's DevTools (Device Toolbar) to emulate various devices (iPhone, iPad, etc.).
- The project respects `prefers-reduced-motion` and provides accessible keyboard navigation.
- Assets are in the `images/` folder; update or replace them as needed.


## Fonts

- The design uses the "Helvetica Neue" font family with sensible fallbacks to system fonts. If you have a local font file, add it to a `fonts/` folder and include an `@font-face` rule in `css/styles.css`.
